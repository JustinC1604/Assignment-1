            <!-- Band overview -->
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond is one of the most iconic and influential rock bands to emerge from Hong Kong, 
                known for their profound impact on the Chinese music scene and their enduring legacy 
                across Asia. Formed in 1983, Beyond blended rock, pop, and elements of social 
                consciousness in their music. The band became prominent in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, 
                Singapore, Malaysia, mainland China, and Overseas Chinese communities. The band is widely 
                considered as the most successful and influential Cantopop band from Hong Kong. In 1993, leader 
                Wong Ka Kui, died at the age of 31 after an accident during the filming of a show at Fuji Television 
                in Tokyo. Beyond continued to perform and record after Wong Ka Kui's death. In 2005, the remaining 
                members Paul Wong, Wong Ka Keung and Yip Sai Wing decided to pursue their own solo careers, 
                and Beyond officially disbanded.

            <!-- Band History -->
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond was founded in 1983 by Wong Ka Kui, Yip Sai Wing, and later joined by Wong Ka Keung and Paul Wong. 
                They started as an underground band influenced by Western rock, playing in small venues and creating music 
                with experimental and social themes. Their first album, Goodbye Ideal (1986), reflected their passion for idealism 
                but struggled commercially. The band's early years were marked by financial struggles and a lack of mainstream recognition.
                Their 1988 album Secret Police featured the hit "大地" (The Earth), which won the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Award, propelling 
                them into the spotlight. Beyond's music began addressing global and social issues. Songs like "光輝歲月" (Glorious Years) 
                were inspired by international events, such as Nelson Mandela's fight against apartheid, showcasing their deep social consciousness.
                During this period, Beyond expanded their fanbase beyond Hong Kong, achieving significant success in Taiwan, 
                mainland China, Japan, and other parts of Asia.
            </p>

            <p>
                While promoting the band in Japan, Wong Ka Kui tragically fell from a stage during a TV show recording on June 24, 1993, 
                and passed away six days later. His death was a devastating blow to the band and their fans. Wong Ka Kui was the creative 
                and emotional heart of Beyond, and his loss marked a turning point. Despite the tragedy, the remaining members continued as 
                a trio, releasing albums such as Paradise (1993) and Sound (1995). However, the band's dynamic had changed, and their music 
                shifted to a more commercial style. Beyond officially disbanded in 2005, with the members pursuing solo careers. They reunited 
                occasionally for special performances.
